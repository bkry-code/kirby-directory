# kirby.directory

[Kirby](https://getkirby.com) is a file-based CMS by Bastian Allgeier. Unlike other systems such as ModX, Typo3 or even Wordpress, it can be set up quickly and yet is very flexible. It also allows extensions using plugins.

This page is a frontend [for the great plugin collection](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins) of Jens TÃ¶rnell on Github. Since Github itself is only moderately usable and I always wanted to implement a project with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), I took the opportunity and built a frontend myself using the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

You can find the site here: https://kirby.directory

## FAQ

### *Who are you?*
I am Florenz Heldermann and an independent frontend developer from Bremen, Germany. More information can be found on my [site](https://flore.nz), [blog](https://flore.nz/blog) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/track02). On LinkedIn and Xing I can also be found, but don't even get the idea to reach me there in a timely manner.

### *The page does not load correctly!*
Github is very restrictive regarding external access to the search API. This is why all issues are downloaded the first time you load the page and saved in your browser using localStorage. Due to this limitation, it is possible that the calls have just been used up. Just wait 30-60 seconds and reload the page.

### *The results are outdated.*
All plugins are in your browser cache. Although this is deleted once a week, it is possible that not all newer results will be displayed. So if you miss anything, reset the cache. You can find a link in the sidebar.

### *How can I add my plugin?*
Not here at all. Please go to the [plugin repository](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins) on Github and add an issue. The issue should have a title, a short summary and a link to your Github repository.

### *I have a problem with Plugin XYZ!!!!1111oneeleven*
Don't ask me, ask the plugin author.

### *I have a problem with Kirby. Can you help me?*
No! That's what the [Kirby Support Forum](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins) is for.

### *What was this site built with?*
This site was built using Vue.js, vue-cli (with webpack-simple), [VueMarkdown](https://github.com/miaolz123/vue-markdown) and the Github Api.

### *Um... So no Kirby?*
Right. This page is currently the only page I have written by myself. Probably as soon as [Kirby 3](https://getkirby.com/next) (with the new built-in Rest API) is released I will use a Kirby installation as backend.

### *Your code sucks!*
I know. I'm still learning. You can write me an E-mail or create a pull request on Github. And ... don't be mean!

### *Since this is a FAQ, where is the bad joke that always comes last?*
I haven't had time for that yet.
